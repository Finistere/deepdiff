/** Used to compare all the fields of a record and aggregate their results.
  *
  * @param unsafeRecordComparator Used before comparing the fields individually for performance.
  * @param diffAccumulators A [[FieldDiffAccumulator]] for each field that needs to be compared. It
  *                         must include all the fieldsWithNestedRecords.
  * @param fieldsWithNestedRecords When the binary comparison is sufficient to prove equality of the
  *                                records, we still don't know which fields are actually present or
  *                                null. This is important for nested fields as it changes the identical
  *                                count. For example, if the nested struct was null the identical count
  *                                of its fields is not increased, but it should be otherwise.
  * @param keysFullName            Key fields present in the compared record. A [[FieldDiffAccumulator]] won't be
  *                                generated for them as they've already been compared through the key. But we still
  *                                need to generate a [[LeftRightRawDiffsPart]] entry in the report. As their identical
  *                                depends on the number of matched records, this is the easiest place to do so.
