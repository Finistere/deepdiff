/** Used to generate a RAW example of a field/record.

  * Raw examples are generated on the spot, in the executors, they do not require to be human
  * friendly and hence can stay in serialized/binary format. Human friendly examples are not
  * always needed as each executor may generate `maxExamples` examples and we only need
  * `maxExamples` at the end. So human friendly examples are only generated in the driver
  * once everything has been aggregated.
